As the amount of text gets larger, there is often a need to save these embedding vectors into a dedicated vector index or library, so that developers won't have to recompute the embeddings and the retrieval process is faster. We can then search for documents based on our intended query and pass these relevant documents into a language model (LM) as additional context.
