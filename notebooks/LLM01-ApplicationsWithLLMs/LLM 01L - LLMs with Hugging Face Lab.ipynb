If True, then it will do random sampling which can optionally use the top-p and/or top-k sampling techniques.  See the blog post linked below for more details on sampling techniques.\n",

    "  * `min_length`, `max_length`: Generative models can be instructed to generate new text between these token lengths.\n",

    "  * `top_p`: (for sampling) This controls the use of top-p sampling, which forces sampling to ignore low-probability tokens by limiting to the top tokens making up probability mass p.  Set to 0 to disable top-p sampling.\n",
    "  * `temperature`: (for sampling) This controls the \"temperature\" of the softmax.  Lower values bias further towards high-probability next tokens.  Setting to 0 makes sampling equivalent to greedy search.\n",
